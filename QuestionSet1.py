# Q1. Write a program to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
# a = 10 
# b = 20
# print (f"Before Swaping  Values of a = {a} And b = {b}")
# a, b = b, a
# print (f"After Swaping  Values of a = {a} And b = {b}")


# Q2. Write a program that takes input from the user and checks its data type.
# a = input("Enter the Value : ")
# if a.isdigit():
#     print(f"The value is int")
# elif a.replace(".", "", 1).isdigit():
#     print("The value is float ")
# else :
#     print("The value is string")
